# VitalTrack - Real-Time Patient Monitoring

This project solves the problem of delayed patient diagnostics by enabling real-time monitoring of vitals like ECG, SpO2, blood pressure, temperature, and limb movements.
It is built using Next.js for the frontend and can integrate with hardware like an Arduino with IoT sensors for real-world data collection. It enables remote access to patient data through a secure, responsive interface.

### Key Features:
*   **Real-time Vital Tracking:** Live dashboard for monitoring critical patient vitals.
*   **Intelligent AI Alerts:** Leverages Generative AI to analyze vital sign data, determine the severity of threshold breaches, and provide actionable recommendations.
*   **High Accuracy:** The system is designed for high accuracy in vital tracking (over 92% in tests), enhancing emergency response capabilities.
*   **Scalable Telemedicine:** Provides a foundation for scalable telemedicine support, allowing healthcare professionals to monitor patients remotely.
